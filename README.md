# 🌦️ Weather Widget

A clean and simple weather widget built using **React** and the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

🛠️ I built this while I was learning how to work with APIs in React. It helped me understand how to use `useState`, handle user input, and manage asynchronous data with fetch.

This app allows users to search for the current weather in any city and displays real-time weather data including temperature, weather condition, and location in a clean and responsive UI.
